Video comparison is a common task that people engage in when interacting with video contents, for instance, in video browsing and video editing. However, there exists little guidance to prompt and assist designers about a comparison task when designing user interfaces and interactions for a video application. To develop the guidance, we are synthesizing relevant knowledge from related research areas and our own prototypes into a theoretical model that pertains key elements and their relationships that characterise the interaction of video comparison. Here, we present a design originated from this model and an informal user study that helped us test and refine the model. The case study demonstrates the model's potential in shedding new lights on how applications that support video comparison could be designed better and also in offering avenues for future research in applications that depend on video comparison, regardless of domain areas.
