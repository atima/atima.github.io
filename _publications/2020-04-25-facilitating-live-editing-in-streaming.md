Media assets, such as overlay graphics or comments, can make video streaming a unique and engaging experience. Appropriately managing media assets during the live streaming, however, is still difficult for streamers who work alone or in small groups. With the aim to ease the management of such assets, we analyzed existing live production tools and designed four low fidelity prototypes, which eventually led to two high fidelity ones, based on the feedback from users and designers. The results of a usability test, using fully interactive prototypes, suggested that a controller and predefined media object behavior were useful for managing objects. The findings from this preliminary work help us design a prototype that helps users to stream rich media presentations.
