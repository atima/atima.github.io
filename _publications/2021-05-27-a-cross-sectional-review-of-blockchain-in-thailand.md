Blockchain technology, a decentralized database that encourages collaboration, transparency, and security, is popular in Thailand, as seen from many practical projects. Nevertheless, information about Thailandâ€™s blockchain ecosystem is incomplete. We conducted literature reviews of research articles, education courses, and industry projects, to explore blockchain from the technology adoption flow including academic research, knowledge acquisition, and project implementation. Blockchain research articles were collected from the Scopus database, while projects and courses were retrieved from an internet search. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 13 research articles, 50 courses, and 54 industry projects, dated from 2016 to 2020, were included in our review. Based on an analysis with respect to trends, focuses, and characteristics in all three aspects, we found that blockchain technology in Thailand was in its infancy, but has been increasing in numbers and domain varieties. However, blockchain technology did not move towards the same direction for all aspects. Most research articles were found in government services, supply chain, and traceability domains; while most projects were in the financial domains. We offer possible explanations for this observation. This paper provides challenges and opportunities for the research community and involved parties in practical implementation.
