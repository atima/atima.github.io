Comparison is often a basis for understanding, discovering, evaluating, and improving an artifact or process. Throughout my PhD thesis, I will investigate various problems related to visual temporal media (e.g. video) and develop theories and systems to support the comparison of such media through iterative and user-centered design. Results will help us understand comparison task more deeply and establish design implications to support general temporal media comparison as well as improve activities that rely on visual comparison.
