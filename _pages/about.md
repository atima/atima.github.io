I’m a Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher and full-stack web developer with a PhD from Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)). My work blends academic research with practical system design, from blockchain-based agri-food traceability to physical training systems, and now mobile-friendly cartograms.

I enjoy building interactive applications as part of my research, and I’m especially interested in how emerging technologies like AI can push the boundaries of user experience.

**What I Do**

- **Design & Research**: Human-centered experiments and user interface design.
- **Build & Ship**: Full-stack web and mobile development (JavaScript, Python).
- **Collaborate & Lead**: Work across disciplines and cultures; former Chair of [Bangkok ACM SIGCHI Chapter](https://www.facebook.com/bkk.sigchi).
