I am currently a PostDoc at National Electronics and Computer Technology Center [(NECTEC)](https://www.nectec.or.th/en/). I was a system engineer at National Science and Technology Development Agency ([NSTDA](https://www.nstda.or.th/)) (2012 - 2015) and research assistant at National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology [(BIOTEC)](http://www.biotec.or.th/) (2011 - 2012). I was in [SHUAI Lab](https://shuailab.wordpress.com/) and got a PhD from Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)) in 2020. I received  my Master's degree from Asian Institute of Technology ([AIT](https://www.ait.ac.th/)) in 2011 and Bachelor's degree from [Mahidol University](https://mahidol.ac.th/) in 2009.

My research interest is user interface design and Human-Computer Interaction. I am working on user interface design for blockchain application. I love web programming but also look forward to bring new technologies, such as VR or AR, to my research.
