I am currently a PhD student in [SHUAI Lab](https://shuailab.wordpress.com/) at Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)). Before coming to Singapore, I was in Thailand. I previously worked at National Science and Technology Development Agency ([NSTDA](https://www.nstda.or.th/)) as a system engineer (2012 - 2015) and research assistant (2011 - 2012). I recieved my Master's degree from Asian Institute of Technology ([AIT](https://www.ait.ac.th/)) in 2011 and Bachelor's degree from [Mahidol University](https://mahidol.ac.th/) in 2009.

My research interest is Human-Computer Interaction, especially in designing a framework to support multimedia comparison and activities that depend on comparison such as analysis or decision making. I love web programming but also look forward to bring new technologies, such as VR or AR, to my research.
