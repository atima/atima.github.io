I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at National Electronics and Computer Technology Center ([NECTEC](https://www.nectec.or.th/en/)). I received bachelor's degree from [Mahidol University](https://mahidol.ac.th/) in 2009 and master's degree from Asian Institute of Technology ([AIT](https://www.ait.ac.th/)) in 2011. After that, I worked as a research assistant at National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ([BIOTEC](http://www.biotec.or.th/)) (2011 - 2012) and moved to National Science and Technology Development Agency ([NSTDA](https://www.nstda.or.th/)) to be a system engineer (2012 - 2015).
I was in [SHUAI Lab](https://shuailab.wordpress.com/) and got a PhD from Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)) in 2020.

My research interest is user interface design and Human-Computer Interaction. I am working on two main application areas: blockchain-based agri-food traceability and physical movement training. I love web programming but also look forward to bring new technologies, such as VR or AR, to my research. Lately, I am also interested in challenges in conducting usability study remotely.

I am the treasurer of [Bangkok ACM SIGCHI Chapter](https://www.facebook.com/bkk.sigchi) (1 July 2021 - 30 June 2022) and the chair of the chapter (1 July 2022 - 30 June 2023).
